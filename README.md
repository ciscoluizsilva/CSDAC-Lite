# CSDAC-Lite

An example library to handle Dynamic Objects on your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center (FMC) using the Dynamic Objects API endpoints.

## Usage

You can import this library and use as-is, there are a couple of examples in the `src` folder.
If you decide to install through git, you may import the library as:

```python
from csdac_lite import FMCClient
```

## About Support
Although written by a Cisco Employee, this has no support from Cisco. This is a personal project and is not supported by Cisco in any way.

This should be used more as an example of how to use the Dynamic Objects API endpoints on FMC, and not as a production ready library.
